<p> <center-align> (4)Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and caldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
  In the caldron boil <br> </br>and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog ,
  Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting<br> </br>,
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.</p>
